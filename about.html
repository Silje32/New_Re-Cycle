                  <p class="best">Re-cycle was founded in 2014 after big complaints from
                                  tourists experiencing long bus trips stuck in traffic and
                                  difficulty seeing our sad tourists that did not get the
                                  opportunity to see our wonderfully parks and amazing mountains.</p>
                  <p>We designed 5 bike trips; east, west, north, south and city,
                     so our tourists get a taste of everything this city has to offer.
                     Both in history, experiences, nature, food and shops.</p>
                  <p class="clear">We know our town and we think the best way to
                                   experience it is by riding a bike with any of our guides.</p>
                  <p class="center">We trust that our guides will give you the
                                    best experience possible.</p>
                  <p class="center">All of our bikes are eco-friendly so take as
                                    many trips as you want.</p>

                              is important".</blockquote>
